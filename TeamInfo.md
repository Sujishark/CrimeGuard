## Project Summary

Crime Guard is intended to be a web-based application that helps users track live crimes that are happening in and around their vicinity. CrimeGuard features a collection of a long history of crimes that have occurred in the area over the years. By mapping this vast data coverage on a map and being able to pinpoint the exact location where the specific crime occurred, the people who end up using CrimeGuard are well informed about problematic neighborhoods and suspect pockets of residential areas within the city.In addition to aggregating crimes nearby on a map view, CrimeGuard also allows users to report crimes by themselves via the application. This helps the users to stay up-to-date with the public safety situation in their surroundings.
